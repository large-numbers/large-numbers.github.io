      <h2>Welcome to Adesdae's Large Number Site</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my site on large numbers, or googology as it is also known. If you're wondering why this website exists, and why anyone would make this, and the answer 'because it's fun' isn't good enough, then you're probably in the wrong part of the internet for you. Here you can (occasionally) find some webpages about large numbers, some of which I came up with, some of which I did not. Currently, they mainly discussing my notation in a little detail, and contain a large number of large numbers. Hopefully at some point the website will contain information on the work of other googologists, and be free from pages which have said "page under construction" or "coming soon" for a length of time considerably longer than what could possibly be described as "soon". Firstly, though, we can look at the fast-growing hierarchy (FGH).</p>
      <h2>Section 0: Preface</h2>
      <p>Here is some information about me and the site:</p>
      <p><a href="about-me.html">About me</a></p>
      <p><a href="about-site.html">About this site</a></p>
      <h2>Section 1: Ordinals and the Fast-Growing Hierarchy (under construction)</h2>
      <p>An overview of the fast-growing hierarchy (FGH), to allow for ordinals to compare my notation to compare to.</p>
      <p><a href="ordinals.html">Introduction to ordinals</a>: They're infinity, but there are bigger and smaller ones and normal math still (sort of) works on them. How does that work?</p>
      <p>Ordinal functions: An exploration of how some of the ordinal functions work, as well as ordinal collapsing functions. Here I introduce my collapsing function known as Adesdae's &theta; function. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>The fast-growing hierarchy: An exploration of the fast-growing hierarchy, as well as some other ordinal hierarchies. (coming soon)</p>
      <h2>Section 2: Large Number Notations (coming soon)</h2>
      <p>An overview of some of the large number notations of others, as well as some of my extensions to those notations.</p>
      <p>-illion numbers: We're all familiar with numbers like million, billion, trillion, etc. but how far do the "illion" numbers go? Here I will attempt to answer that question. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Bowers Exploding Array Function: Jonathan Bowers created his own array notation known as Bowers Exploding Array Function (BEAF), as well as some numbers defined with it. Here I will define some more numbers. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Hyper-E Notation: Sbiis Saibian created his own system known as the Extensible-E System (ExE). Here I will attempt to extend the system, starting with Hyper-Hyper-Hyper-Extended Cascading-E Notation (###xE^). (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Bird's Array Notation: Chris Bird offered a formalization of BEAF known as Bird's Array Notation (BAN) with limit ordinal &theta;(&Omega;<sub>&Omega;</sub>). Here I will propose an extension with limit ordinal &theta;(I). (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Hyperfactorial Array Notation: Lawrence Hollom created his own array notation known as Hyperfactorial Array Notation (HAN). Here I will attempt to extend the notation. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Strong Array Notation: Googology Wiki user Hyp cos created his own array notation known as Strong Array Notation (SAN). This will form the basis of my separator-arrays. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Username5243's Array Notation: Googology Wiki user Username5243 created his own array notation known as Username5243's Array Notation (UNAN). This will form the basis of my main arrays. (coming soon).</p>
      <h2>Section 3: Adesdae's Array Notation (coming soon)</h2>
      <p>Here I introduce my own array notation known as Adesdae's Array Notation (AAN).</p>
      <p>Single-Entry Array Notation: This is the 0th extension of AAN, and has limit ordinal &omega;. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Linear Array Notation: This is the 1st extension of AAN, and has limit ordinal &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Dimensional Array Notation: This is the 2nd extension of AAN, and has limit ordinal &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup>. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Hyperdimensional Array Notation: This is the 3rd extension of AAN, and has limit ordinal &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Expanding Array Notation: This is the 4th extension of AAN, and has limit ordinal &theta;(&Omega;<sub>2</sub>). (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Multiexpanding Array Notation: This is the 5th extension of AAN, and has limit ordinal &theta;(I). (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Dropping Array Notation: This is the 6th extension of AAN, and has limit ordinal &theta;(&Psi;<sup>1</sup>(K&omega;)). (coming soon)</p>
      <p>Nested Dropper Array Notation: This is the 7th and final extension of AAN, and has limit ordinal &theta;(&Psi;<sup>1</sup>(&Psi;<sup>2</sup>(...))). (coming soon)</p>
      <p>AAN Numbers: Here I will define some numbers defined by my array notation. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>&Omega; function: My own idea for an uncomputable function to make the biggest numbers ever. (coming soon)</p>
      <h2>Section 4: Comparing Systems (coming soon)</h2>
      <p>Here I will compare my array notation to the fast-growing hierarchy, as well as BEAF. Here I will introduce the so-called <i>catching hierarchy</i>.</p>
      <p>Catching Hierarchy: Here I will define the catching hierarchy, an ordinal function that relates the slow-growing hierarchy to the fast-growing hierarchy. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>BEAF to Catching Hierarchy: Here I will compare BEAF to the catching hierarchy. This will serve as a sort of "lemma", that will be used in the later articles. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>AAN to FGH: Here I will compare my array notation to the fast-growing hierarchy of professional mathematics. (coming soon)</p>
      <p>AAN to BEAF: Here I will compare my array notation to the Bowers Exploding Array Function (BEAF). (coming soon)</p>
