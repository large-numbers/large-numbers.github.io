      <p>It seems till November 2020, when I discovered googology for myself, I had not knew numbers bigger than googol (I am not a mathematician). Since this moment during free time I learned many new terms &ndash; Up-arrow notation and chained arrow notation, BEAF, FGH, and so on. It was wonderful travelling in the never ending universe of great numbers &ndash; farther and farther. Several weeks later I thought that and I could do my own little contribution for googology.</p>
