      <p>First of all, what is an ordinal? An ordinal is a type of infinity. So how can there be more than one of them? They're from set theory where infinity + 1 does not equal infinity, but 1 + infinity does. Why can't it be more helpful? Because.</p>
      <p>An ordinal is defined as the set of all smaller ordinals. The smallest possible ordinal, 0, is defined to be the empty set ({}), since no ordinal is smaller than 0. We then define the ordinal 1 = {0} = {{}}. Next, we can define 2 = {0,1} = {{},{{}}}. We can continue with 3 = {0,1,2} = {{},{{}},{{},{{}}}}, 4 = {0,1,2,3} = {{},{{}},{{},{{}}},{{},{{}},{{},{{}}}}}, etc. but the ordinal system continues with the first transfinite ordinal &#x03C9;. &#x03C9; is the first ordinal above all finite ordinals. It is also equal to {0,1,2,3,...} = {{},{{}},{{},{{}}},{{},{{}},{{},{{}}}},...}. We can then define &#x03C9;+1 as the set containing all ordinals before &#x03C9; and then &#x03C9;. We can also define &#x03C9;+2 as the set containing all ordinals before &#x03C9;+1 and then &#x03C9;+1. Let's define S(&#x03B1;) as the ordinal "above" &#x03B1;. In other words, it is the set containing all the members of &#x03B1; and then &#x03B1;. This can be more formally written as &#x03B1;&#x222A;{&#x03B1;}.</p>
      <p>We can continue by defining &#x03C9;2 as the supremum of &#x03C9;+1, &#x03C9;+2, etc. &#x03C9;3 as the supremum of &#x03C9;2+1, &#x03C9;2+2, etc. We can also define &#x03C9;<sup>2</sup> as the supremum of &#x03C9;2, &#x03C9;3, etc. &#x03C9;<sup>3</sup> as the supremum of &#x03C9;<sup>2</sup>2, &#x03C9;<sup>2</sup>3, etc. We can also define &#x03C9;<sup>&#x03C9;</sup> as the supremum of &#x03C9;<sup>2</sup>, &#x03C9;<sup>3</sup>, etc. &#x03C9;<sup>&#x03C9;<sup>&#x03C9;</sup></sup> as the supremum of &#x03C9;<sup>&#x03C9;<sup>2</sup></sup>, &#x03C9;<sup>&#x03C9;<sup>3</sup></sup>, etc. Eventually we reach &#x03C9;<sup>&#x03C9;<sup>&#x03C9;<sup>...</sup></sup></sup>, known as &#x03B5;<sub>0</sub>. It is the smallest ordinal &#x03B1; = &#x03C9;<sup>&#x03B1;</sup>. At this point, we need a new definition of ordinals that will be explained in the next article...</p>
