    <div id="page-content">
      <p>Welcome to Adesdae's Large Number Site, a site where I attempt to define the biggest numbers ever. Please note that this is not the first site on the internet to define large numbers. The earliest I have seen was <a href="http://mrob.com/pub/math/largenum.html">Robert Munafo's large number webpage</a>, dating back as far as 1996. Another example was <a href="http://www.polytope.net/hedrondude/home.htm">Jonathan Bowers' site</a>, created in 2002. Munafo was primarily interested in explaining the certain notations generating large numbers, while Bowers was primarily interested in making his own system to push the theoretical limit of numbers created by humanity. My site is the first to merge these two topics into one site.</p>
      <h2>Site layout</h2>
      <p>The site is comprised of five sections, each section discussing a certain topic. Currently there is only one section.</p>
      <p><b>Section 1</b> will explain how ordinals and the fast-growing hierarchy work, as well as certain functions to generate ordinals.</p>
      <p><b>Section 2</b> will explain how some large number notations of others work, as well as some of my extensions to those systems.</p>
      <p><b>Section 3</b> will introduce some of my own work, including my array function known as Adesdae's Array Notation (AAN), and some numbers defined with it.</p>
      <p><b>Section 4</b> will compare my array notation to the fast-growing hierarchy, as well as some other people's work.</p>
      <p><b>Section 5</b> will contain a complete list of numbers, some I coined, some I did not.<p>
